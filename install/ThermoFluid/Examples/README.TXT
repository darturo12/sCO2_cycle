many of the examples in this directory are currently just tests to
veryfy that the models work as expected.

Useful demo examples are:

ControlledAttemperator.mos	runs a distributes attemperator model
				under PID control
PressureWaveDemo.mos		demonstrates pressure waves in an air pipe
FlowCharacteristic.mos		demonstrates a special two-phase flow feature
				of pressure drop follow the plotting instructions
				in script.
FlowLimitCycle.mos		shows limit cycles in an
				evaporator/surge tank configuration
ReactionTest			Dynamic model of a H2/O2 combustion.
EvaporatorPipe.mos		demonstrates discretization artefacts with
				discretized models and phase changes
EvaporatorPipeD.mos		demonstrates discretization artefacts with
				discretized models and phase changes,
				dynamic momentum balance (very slow!).

All other models are currently only used for testing of models. Not
all of them are actually working.
